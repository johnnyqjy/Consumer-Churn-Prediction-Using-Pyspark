# Abstract
Consumer churn is a major concern in various industries, including the telecommunication industry. However, the class imbalance problem presents a significant challenge in accurately predicting churn, as traditional machine learning algorithms often exhibit bias towards the dominant class. In this paper, authors explore different techniques to address the data imbalance issue, such as Random Oversampling, Random Under-sampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, combined with various machine learning algorithms, including K-means Clustering, Decision Trees, and ensemble methods Random Forest. The performance of different combinations are evaluated using metrics such as area under ROC curve, accuracy, and F1 score. This paper provides valuable insights for telecommunication companies seeking to develop effective user retention strategies.
